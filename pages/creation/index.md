Let's create fearlessly for the next 6 months. Till the end of the year, I need a solid direction. 

**Weekly Log**: Note here what to do, and track progress. Every week I need to do something, try something, learn something. 

{% callout %} Maybe this is the push I needed? When there's really a fire under my ass? {% /callout %}

I guess my first instinct is to start with a bunch of things and see what sticks.

Some stuff that's been in my mind:

**Making stuff**
- [discograph](/discograph): playlist organizer/ / live radio / netlofi?
    - damn netlofi could just be a livestream of that youtube thing?
- [footy boi](/footy-boi): some kind of football app 
- Contextual tooltip: Give every link a nice preview 
- Figma plugins & widgets
- Ringtones: I've been sitting on this one for too long.
- Mixtapes: I really want to do something with music curation. 

**Sellling stuff**
- **Shopify themes**: EJ said they feel like a heavier lift, but can I get away outside the Shopify store? E-commerce definitely feels like a place where lower lift products can have a lot of movement. Other places I can explore? My own little shop?
    - Other web templates: What else could I tackle? What platforms are most people using? Ghost I heard is doing good. 
- **Design assets**: I only really know Figma.
    - small stuff: resume, small templates. actually there aren't a bunch of branding collateral stuff on there. ðŸ¤”
    - UI design assets: card templates, maps stuff, 
    - Whole kits and systems: eventual goal, but requires a lot of proficiency. 

**big picture**
- [ ] Build audience
- [ ] Make small things and share them - it's ok, nobody cares.
- [ ] Read those books and make some use man

**lil todos**
- [ ] Cheaper theme stores: Themeforest, and all?
- [ ] Start... tweeting... more? whoa

Netlify is a great place to work and I can literally target the things I want to learn - design systems, working with APIs, making tools.
